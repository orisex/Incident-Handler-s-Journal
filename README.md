# Incident Handler‚Äôs Journal

This repository contains my **Incident Handler‚Äôs Journal**, documenting my hands-on practice and learning during my cybersecurity training in July 2025.

## Summary
The journal includes investigation records where I applied practical skills in:

- Security incident detection and response
- Phishing alert investigation and escalation
- Custom intrusion detection system (IDS) rule creation (Suricata)
- Log analysis and parsing (`jq`, `eve.json`)
- Searching and filtering security event logs in SIEM tools (Splunk & Google Chronicle)

## Entries
- **Entry 001:** Investigated a phishing alert involving a malicious file hash
- **Entry 002:** Wrote and triggered a custom Suricata rule for HTTP GET requests
- **Entry 003:** Analyzed Suricata logs with `jq` for detailed alert information
- **Entry 004:** Queried and filtered logs in Splunk and Chronicle SIEM platforms

## Purpose
This journal demonstrates my ability to perform entry-level security analysis tasks such as:

- Triage and escalation of alerts
- IDS rule creation and customization
- Log file analysis and filtering
- SIEM searches and data correlation

## Tools used:
- Suricata IDS
- jq (for JSON parsing)
- Splunk Cloud (SPL searches)
- Google Security Operations (Chronicle UDM and raw log searches)
